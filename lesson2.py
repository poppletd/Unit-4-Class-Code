# For loop style 1 - for i in range(stop)
# this prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 each on their own line
# the number in range(stop) is how many nums are printed
# starting at 0 and ending at stop-1

# common use: doing a known number of things
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# nums on same line
for i in range(5):
    print(i,end=" ")
print()
for i in range(5):
    print(i,end=", ")

# For loop style 2 - for i in range(start, stop)
# this prints start, start+1, ...., stop-1
# loop runs stop-start number of times
for num in range(2,6):
    print("*"*num)

    print(f"{num_to_square}  |  {num_to_square**2}")

# For loop style 3 - for i in range(start, stop, step)
# this prints start, start+1, ...., stop-1 but counts by step
# loop runs ceiling((stop-start)/step) times
# ceiling means round up to nearest int

# 1) ask the user to enter 5 numbers (hint: use 5 variables and a loop)
# 2) find the average of those numbers (hint: use a loop)
# 3) print "The average of your numbers is ----"
